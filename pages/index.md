## Getting started

I created these pages to keep track of my learning progress towards developing my own home assistant custom integration. Originally, my goal was to integrate my DALI-infrastructure into HA. As my DALI controllers and relais were some custom fabrication, I could not reuse some of the work already out there and had to create my own integration. 

A first attempt got stuff working, but I felt that I still didn't fully undertand what was happening. And that's something I don't like. I really like Home Assistant and it is something I can see become a new hobby. However, getting to the point where you can confidently start building a custom integration and don't feel like you're just hacking other people's code until you got things to work, isn't easy.

While there is quite some documentation out there as well as a vibrant community, I do feel there is something missing out there. A source for people who want to learn how to develop their own custom integration. The way I see it, we need something that meets the following requirements:
- A proper explanation of the architecture of Home Assistant
- Some good examples of integrations that can act as references
- A proper understanding of key parts of the core HA code
- A repository of usefull resources
- Step-by-step tutorials to develop your own customer integrations

I have no idea where this project will lead me, but hopefully it can become useful to other people too. Let's get started.
